### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Mthokozisi from South Africa, and I have experience in Software Development, Azure Cloud Engineer, and IT Support & Technical.  I really enjoy learning languages and frameworks like Angular, React, C#, Java, Python, JavaScript, and TypeScript, as well as working in WordPress. I also enjoy wireframing, ui, ux, and design in general.
